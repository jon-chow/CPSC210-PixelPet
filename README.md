## Project Overview

As the name of this project suggests, this is an *interactive* application game where   
you are tasked to take care of a **virtual pet** of *your* choosing. It is a simplified desktop    
version of the popular toy in the late 1990's and early 2000's; the **Tamagotchi**.

The intended user audiences for this application are *children and teens*, however,   
the game itself is suitable for people of all ages as it makes for a pleasant pastime.  
As someone who dreams of having a little companion and is passionate about game     
development, this project is the ideal. In addition, it will allow me to explore the    
vastness of **OOP** in both a **structural** and **creative** manner.
